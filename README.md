## Supporting data for the nif gene cluster reconstitution in the Nitrogen-Fixing Cyanobacterium Calothrix sp. NIES-4101. 

   
This repository includes;  
1, Sanger sequencing reads for PCR amplifing nifH1DKB genes from heterocyst induced cells.  
2, Raw contig sequences assembled from clipped paired-end sequencing reads (the schematic workflow is shown in Fig. 1).   
3, Code for reconstruction of the nif gene clusters.
